Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? It's cold, but it's beautiful. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Let's have a nice tree right here. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the
 world that you want. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

Let the paint work. Just use the old one inch brush. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.

Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.
